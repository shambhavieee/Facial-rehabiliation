This project develops a real-time facial rehabilitation progress tracker that uses MediaPipe Face Mesh (468 landmarks) and OpenCV to monitor facial symmetry and movement during therapy exercises.The system captures live webcam input to produce visual progress graphs to quantify rehabilitation over time.
